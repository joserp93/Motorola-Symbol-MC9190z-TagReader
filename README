This is a sample WinForms embedded application for the Windows Mobile 6.5 Standard Device using .NET 2.0
It utilizes the Motorola Symbol Enterprsie Mobility Development Kit (a.k.a Symbol SDK) version 2.4 and
the the Symbol.RFID3.Device.DLL.

The application will only work with a Motorola handheld MC9190-Z series. It will not work with the MC9090
series that utilizes the older Symbol.RFID2.Device.DLL.

When the sample is run it will open a form window with a a single read-only textbox input.
The RFID Reader can then read tag IDs at the press and release of the handheld trigger.
The RFID gun can read one tag at a time and the TagID value read is displayed on the textbox.
